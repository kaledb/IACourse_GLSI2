# Artificial Intelligence Course for GLSI 2 
# 3 Pacman Projects + 1 Logic Project

This repo contains 3 Pac-Man projects which were adopted from UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence class, CS 188.
It explores several techniques of Artificial Intelligence such as Searching, Heuristics, Adversarial Behaviour,
Reinforcement Learning etc.

- Project 1: Search - DFS, BFS, UCS, Greedy Search, A* Search

- Project 2: MultiAgent - minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax

- Project 3: Markov Decision Processes & Reinforcement Learning - Value Iteration, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning

Adaptation of the Project Logic from the Course CS221 - Introduction  To AI, Stanford University

- Project 4: Logic

Detailed information about each of these projects can be found under each project's folder.
